Udacity Project- Recoverability in AWS

This is one of the project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.


Project Overview
In this project I have created highly available solutions to common use cases. I have:

Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.
Built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
